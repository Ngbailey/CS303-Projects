To use the File Checker program is simple.
You'll need a .txt file with 10 rows of 10 elements, in this case a filed labled "testfile2.txt" is located within the folder for testing purposes.

upon starting the program you will be asked to enter the filename.
simeply type the exact name of the file including the extension. 
i.e. "testfile2.txt" without the quotation makes: testfile2.txt

you will be asked to enter 1 of 4 commands
'c' to find and count the number of a specific element within the text file.
'm' to modify a specific element into another based on the location of the element from a given index and array.
'a' to add an element to the end of a specific array.
'r' to input and index of a specific array to remove an element from that position.


If you choose option 'c' you will be asked to enter a search term.
Upon being given the search term it will output the index and Array for each occurence of the term.
It will then ask if you want to continue using the program by either pressing "y/Y" or exit the program "n/N".
pressing "y/Y" will return you to the the start where you will have to enter the filename of the file you want to work with again.

If you choose option 'm' you will be asked to enter the index, array #, and the element you want to the original element to be changed to.
it will then output what the old element was and what the new element is.
It will then ask if you want to continue using the program by either pressing "y/Y" or exit the program "n/N".
pressing "y/Y" will return you to the the start where you will have to enter the filename of the file you want to work with again.

If you choose option 'a', it will ask you which array you want to add to the end of and what element you want to add to the end.
It will then ask if you want to continue using the program by either pressing "y/Y" or exit the program "n/N".
pressing "y/Y" will return you to the the start where you will have to enter the filename of the file you want to work with again.

If you choose option 'r', it will ask you to ender the index and array# of the element you want to remove.
it will then inform you the element that was removed and the location it was removed from.
It will then ask if you want to continue using the program by either pressing "y/Y" or exit the program "n/N".
pressing "y/Y" will return you to the the start where you will have to enter the filename of the file you want to work with again.

If you press "n/N" the program will exit.
