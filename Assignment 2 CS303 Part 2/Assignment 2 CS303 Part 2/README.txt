To use the NathanCorp Employee Benefit program is very simple.
All you need to do is start the program and follow the simple prompts.

The first prompt will ask you to enter 'p' or 'np' for professional or non-professional respectively.
entering an incorrect input will loop the program until a correct input is given.

If you select 'p' it will give you the information for professional employees.
Then it will ask you if you want to return to the original prompt.
If you enter 'y' you will return to the original prompt, otherwise the program will end.

If you choose 'np'it will ask you for the hourly rate followed by the hours you would work a week.
If your input is less than 1 or greater than 40 it will loop back and ask you to input a correct input between 1-40 hours.
Upon entering the correct information it will output the non-professional employee information.
Then it will ask you if you want to return to the original prompt.
If you enter 'y' you will return to the original prompt, otherwise the program will end.
